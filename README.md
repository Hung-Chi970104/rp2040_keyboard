## Conclusionl
I gotta be honest working on this wasn't as easy as I thought, mainly beacuse of new layout for RP2040 and my poor planning (yeah that's my problem).......But anyways I'll order this right after I get my RP2040 devboard that I built previously just in case I made some stupid mistakes lol
